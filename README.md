Bunch of quantum information/computing projects/notes for personal learning usage

## What is this project about?
This is the code for my undergraduate thesis project on quantum computation. In this project, I am building an engine optimizing quantum computational resource for the measurement-based quantum computational model, and see if can provide a cheaper resource requirement compare to the unitary circuit implementation. I only have the engine and my algorithms still need polishment at the moment, but I think it is reasonable to actually make a compiler translate the unitary circuit language to measurement-based language and do optimizations on it.
