# quantum-information-stuff
Bunch of quantum information/computing projects/notes for personal learning usage

**NOTE**: I had moved my undergraduate thesis project, a graph-based MBQC compilation optimizer, to another repo. Check https://github.com/aslanzyx/MBQC-Gopt for my undergraduate thesis project.

# What this repo contains?
- `d-wave-qubo`: a series of problem models solved by QUBO/CQM using d-wave's API.
- `qiskit-unitary-circuit`: a series of quantum algorithms implemented using the qiskit API.
